# Skill: Cold-Start Simulation

Before finalizing any change:

1. Assume no settings or configuration file exists.
2. Assume all values load as defaults.
3. Execute each workflow mode mentally under these conditions.
4. Confirm that no workflow requires inputs not visible or defined in its UI.
5. If a workflow fails under cold-start conditions, the implementation must be corrected.
