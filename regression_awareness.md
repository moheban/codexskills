# Skill: Regression Awareness

Before completing any change:

1. Identify all functions and code paths affected.
2. Identify behaviors that must remain unchanged.
3. Confirm that UI wiring, persistence, plotting, and exports remain intact.
4. Explicitly consider how this change could break existing workflows.
5. If a regression risk exists, mitigate it before finalizing.
