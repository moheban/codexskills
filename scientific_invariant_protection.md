# Skill: Scientific Invariant Protection

Preserve scientific invariants at all times.

Examples:
- NaOH must not be reconstructed after equivalence.
- Planning workflows may continue past equivalence.
- pH must evolve according to the correct reaction regime.
- Speciation and predicted pH models must remain consistent unless explicitly overridden.

If a change risks violating a scientific invariant, stop and correct it.
