# Skill: Version-Safe Refactoring Discipline

When modifying code:

1. Always copy the previous version to a new versioned file before editing.
2. Never modify older versions in place.
3. Update all internal version identifiers consistently.
4. Preserve backward compatibility with existing configuration or settings files.
5. Ensure new versions can load older persisted data without failure.
